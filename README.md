# Analyze Data Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a robust and automated data analysis workflow, focusing on data preparation, script execution, code quality assurance, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) for publishing analytical results. It addresses a specific task involving fixing a critical error in a Python script, standardizing data formats, and establishing an automated pipeline to run the analysis and publish its output.

## Features & Functionality

*   **Corrected Data Analysis Script (`execute.py`)**: A non-trivial error within the `execute.py` script has been identified and meticulously fixed, ensuring accurate and reliable data processing.
*   **Data Format Conversion**: The `data.xlsx` file has been converted to `data.csv` for enhanced compatibility, performance, and ease of parsing in automated environments.
*   **Code Quality Assurance**: Integration of `ruff` for linting and formatting ensures high code quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices.
*   **Automated Execution**: A GitHub Actions workflow automates the execution of `execute.py`, generating analysis results without manual intervention.
*   **Results Publishing**: The generated `result.json` output is automatically published to GitHub Pages, providing a live demo of the analysis results.
*   **Environment Standardization**: Ensures the project runs correctly on Python 3.11+ with Pandas 2.3, as specified.
